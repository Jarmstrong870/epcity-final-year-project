Step-by-Step Cypress Testing 

1. Open Cypress Test Runner:
   In the EPC dashboard terminal, run the following command:
   npx cypress open
   (This will launch the Cypress Test Runner interface.)

2. Select the E2E Test:
   - Ensure "E2E Testing" is selected.
   - Choose your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome).
   - Click on the any of the tests to run them, for creating one make sure they end with .cy.js


3. Verify Test Results:
   In the Cypress Test Runner, you will see:
   - Green Checkmarks for passed steps.
   - Red Crosses for any failures.
   (If the test fails, expand the error logs for details.)

5. Rerun the Test (Optional):
   - Click the "Run All Tests" button in Cypress.
   - Or, make code changes and save the test file – Cypress will auto-reload the test.

6. Exit Cypress:
   Once the test passes, close the Cypress Test Runner:
   - Press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the process.
   note if you lock computer test may not run just close down web tab and opening another

If you encounter issues, share the Cypress logs and screenshots to me (Jarm) .
dont worry about orientation of test it looks squished but wont impact functionality 
i have set up googlemaps api and local host to run so writing cy.visit('/') should take you to home page 

also if you havent installed cypress use npm install and check package.json for something like this 
"devDependencies": {
    "cypress": "^14.0.0"
  }
  Happy auto testing
